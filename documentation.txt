This application is a simple to-do list meant as program practicing, only documentation and text searches are allowed. NO AI.
A to-do list does not sound exciting, but the journey with no tutorials is tougher than one would expect.

Being in doubt between Java and Python, the language I ended up choosing to practice first was python, wich comes bundled with two useful modules for the express
purpose of this kind of app, tkinter (for GUI's) and sqlite3 (data storage/retrival).

My first challenge after setting things up and having a way to receive data (through the terminal, no GUI yet) was how to modify specific data on demand. 
The solution was creating an unique id for each row, a column that stores primary keys. This is sufficient for a simple internal system like this.

#dbCursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks(name, state)")
became
#dbCursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, state INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)")
